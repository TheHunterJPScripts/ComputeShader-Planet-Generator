# ComputeShader Planet Generator
 
This is a performance improvement of a previous project. It uses compute shaders to generate the terrain so it can compute it as fast as i was able to achieve. This project have a cap on the amount of vertices that can be added because it generate all the terrain on se same mesh. So in case you want to edit the code take it into consideration. I chose this approach to prevent mismatches on the lighting around the edges of the meshes.
